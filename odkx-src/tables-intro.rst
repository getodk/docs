ODK-X Tables
===============

.. _tables-intro:

:dfn:`ODK-X Tables` is a program that allows you to visualize and update existing data. Using Tables as your entry-point to data collection, you will be able to gather data using ODK-X Survey, sync it to a server using ODK-X Services, and have other users download and edit this same data on their own devices.

Tables also enables web developers to build powerful *data management applications* to handle their complex workflows. While Survey follows a traditional data collection workflow, similar to that of Collect, Tables gives you the flexibility to implement your own arbitrary complex workflow. For example you might collect data via a customized mapping interface: Tables allows you to build an application using web technologies to achieve that.

.. note::

  ODK-X Tables only works on Android 4.2 and newer devices.


We have included a sample application built on top of Tables along with a handful of data tables that showcase some of its features.
