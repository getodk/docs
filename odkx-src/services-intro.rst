ODK-X Services
================

.. _services-intro:

:dfn:`ODK-X Services` is a program that handles database access, file access, and data synchronization services between all the ODK-X applications. Mostly this happens behind the scenes, but you will need to install ODK-X Services as a prerequisite to using the other ODK-X tools.

It also allows you to sync data collected by the ODK-X tools with an ODK-X Cloud Endpoint. The Services application can be used to reset the Cloud Endpoint with the data that is on a tablet or to sync the data on the tablet with what is currently on the Cloud Endpoint.
