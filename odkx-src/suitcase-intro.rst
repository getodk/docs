ODK Suitcase
===============

.. _suitcase-intro:

:dfn:`ODK Suitcase` is a cross-platform tool that provides access to data on an ODK Cloud Endpoint from a personal computer.

Data downloaded from an :doc:`cloud-endpoints-intro` is stored as spreadsheets in CSV format. This format is compatible with most spreadsheet software, for example :program:`Excel` or :program:`Numbers`. Once downloaded, the spreadsheets will be available for offline viewing. Similarly, data to be uploaded to an ODK Cloud Endpoint must be stored in a properly formatted csv file.
