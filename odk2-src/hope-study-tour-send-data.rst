Function
-------------------

This module is the synchronization interface, see the :ref:`Services User Guide <services-using-sync>`. It is included here because it is embedded into the Hope Study workflow. After registering new clients or interviewing existing clients, this module is used to submit that data. Also, before work is started each day, this should be used to ensure the latest forms from all the clients are available on the device.

Implementation
----------------------

The synchronization interface is implemented completely by the ODK 2 platform and it is not customizable. For details on how to launch it through your application files (rather than the default provided sync button), see the :ref:`Main Menu implementation details <hope-study-tour-main-menu-implementation>`.
