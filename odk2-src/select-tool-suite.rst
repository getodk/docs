Selecting the Appropriate Tool Suite
=====================================

Generally, we suggest starting with the ODK 1 tool suite. If it does not fulfill your requirements then move on to the more flexible, but also more complex, ODK 2 tool suite.

.. note::
  It is tempting to look at the version number and assume the latest is the greatest, but this is not always the case. The ODK 2 tool suite was designed to co-exist with the ODK 1 tool suite and does not replace any 1.x tools. In general, the ODK 1 tools are easier to use, require less setup, and are widely adopted.  However, if you have a complex longitudinal study and possess some technical skills, then the ODK 2 tools may be better suited to your needs.


The feature comparison table below illustrates the differences between the ODK 1 and ODK 2 tools.
