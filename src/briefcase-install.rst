Installing Briefcase
----------------------

- Make sure to download and install `Java 8 <https://java.com/en/download/>`_ or higher on your system.
- Download `ODK Briefcase <https://opendatakit.org/downloads/download-category/briefcase/>`_  vN.N.N.jar.
- Double click and start the file.
- If that doesn't work for you try running *java -jar path_to_jar* from the command line.

Upon first starting, Briefcase will ask for the directory under which to create the ODK Briefcase Storage area. An `ODK Briefcase Storage` folder will be created here to hold all the blank forms and finalized forms.

.. tip::

  You can change the storage location for Briefcase from the :guilabel:`Settings` tab.
