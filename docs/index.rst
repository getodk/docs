Welcome to ODK's Docs!
======================

:dfn:`ODK` is a data collection platform that helps researchers, field teams, and other professionals collect the data they need wherever it is. For a quick start, read :doc:`getting-started`.

In most cases, users of ODK:

- Create forms using the :doc:`XLSForm <xlsform>` standard in Excel or Google Sheets.
- :ref:`Upload forms <central-forms-upload>` to an :doc:`ODK Central server <central-intro>`.
- :ref:`Download forms <loading-forms-into-collect>` into the :doc:`ODK Collect app <collect-intro>` on an Android device.
- :doc:`Use Collect to fill out forms <collect-filling-forms>`.
- :ref:`Upload survey data <uploading-forms>` from Collect to Central.
- :doc:`Analyze or export data from Central <central-submissions>`.

While this is the most popular workflow, it is not the only way to do things because ODK is a very flexible platform. For example, instead of using the Collect app, you can use a browser to fill out :ref:`web forms <central-submissions-public-link>`. With ODK, you have complete control over your data collection.

ODK is open-source software that's made by a welcoming community of people just like you. To get involved, join the `community forum <https://forum.getodk.org/>`_ and, if you are a developer, contribute to our code on `GitHub <https://github.com/getodk>`_.
