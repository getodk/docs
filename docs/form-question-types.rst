Question Types
=================

:doc:`collect-intro` supports forms with a wide variety of question types.
The exact functionality and display style of each question
are specified in your :doc:`XLSForm <xlsform>` definition using the
``type`` and ``appearance`` columns.

.. tip::

  You can find an XLSForm with all available question types `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1af_Sl8A_L8_EULbhRLHVl8OclCfco09Hq2tqb9CslwQ/edit#gid=0>`_.

.. admonition:: Helpful terminology

  .. glossary::

    question

      A prompt to the user, usually requesting a response.
      Questions are written as a single line in an XLSForm,
      and usually appear on a single screen in Collect.

    widget

      A rendered question screen in Collect.
      The ``type`` and ``appearance`` of a question
      determine the widget that is displayed.


.. _text-widget:

Text widgets
--------------

All of the text widgets share the ``text`` type,
and the inputs from them are saved as literal strings.

.. warning::

  If you are using Aggregate and expect answers to be more than 255 characters, you should :doc:`increase the database field length to over 255 characters <aggregate-field-length>`.

.. _text-default:

Default text widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``text``
appearance
  *none*

A simple text input.

The text entry field expands as the user types, and line breaks can be included. The keyboard displayed depends on the Android device and user settings.

.. image:: /img/form-question-types/string-input.*
  :alt: Text form widget, displayed in ODK Collect on an Android phone. The label is "What is your name?"
  :class: device-screen-vertical

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, name, label

  text, name, What is your name?

.. _text-area:

Text area
~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``text``
appearance
  ``multiline``

A text area shown as 4 rows. The area can be scrolled as more text is added.

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, name, label, appearance

  text, comments, Comments, multiline

.. _expanding-text-area:

Text area with custom rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``text``
appearance
  *none*

To define the minimum number of rows that a text field should display, use the ``parameters`` column.

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, name, label, parameters

  text, essay, Your essay, rows=15

.. _number-text-widget:

Number text widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``text``
appearance
  ``numbers``


A numerical input that treats the input as a string, rather than a number.

The number input accepts numerals (``0123456789``), hyphens (``-``), and decimal separators (``.`` and ``,``). These are the only characters available on the number keypad displayed with this widget.

This is useful for phone numbers, ID numbers, IP addresses, and similar data. It can also be used in place of the :ref:`default-integer-widget` or :ref:`default-decimal-widget` if large numbers are needed (the integer widget has a limit of nine digits, and the decimal widget has a limit of 15 characters).

.. image:: /img/form-question-types/string-number.*
  :alt: The text widget, with numerical entry, as displayed in the ODK Collect app on an Android phone. The question text is "String number widget." The hint text is, "text type with numbers appearance." Below that is a simple input. Above the question text is the form group name "Text Widget." The Android onscreen keyboard displays a number pad.
  :class: device-screen-vertical

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, name, label, appearance, hint

  text,string_number_widget,String number widget,numbers,text type with numbers appearance

.. warning::
  It's not guaranteed that the result will be a well-formed number. For example, it might be ``.0,1-2 5``. If you know the expected format of the value, you can add constraints to ensure it meets your requirements. For instance, if you only want numbers greater than or equal to zero (without decimal separators), you can use a regular expression like ``regex(.,'^[0-9]*$')`` for validation.

.. note::

  This appearance can be combined with the :ref:`thousands-sep <thousands-sep>` appearance.


.. _external-app-widget:

External app string widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``text``
appearance
  ``ex.*``

Launches an external app and receives a string input back from the external app. If the specified external app is not available, a manual input is prompted.

The external app widget is displayed when the ``appearance`` attribute begins with ``ex:``. The rest of the ``appearance`` string specifies the application to launch.

.. seealso:: :doc:`collect-external-apps`

.. image:: /img/form-question-types/external-app-widget-start.*

Hiding the received value
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

By default, the received value is shown below the widget button. In some cases, the raw received value is not helpful to display. For example, it may be very long or may represent a list of values. In that case, you can use the ``hidden-answer`` appearance. We generally recommend putting this question in a :ref:`field-list <field-list>` to provide some useful feedback about the received value.

.. _masked-text-widget:

Masking the entered value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``text``
appearance
  ``masked``

If ``masked`` is added to ``appearance``, the answers will be obscured with dots similar to password-protected fields. This can be used to hide input as it is being entered but it does not provide any security measures beyond that.

.. warning::
  Answers will remain masked within questions utilizing this appearance, as well as in the summary screen. However, if referenced in labels or calculations, they will be accessible and displayed like any other values, without any protective measures.

.. warning::
  It's only possible to mask answers in :ref:`text-default`. It will not work with :ref:`number-text-widget` or :ref:`number-widgets`.


.. _number-widgets:

Number widgets
---------------------

Number widgets collect and store number inputs ---
either :ref:`integers <default-integer-widget>` or
:ref:`floating-point decimals <default-decimal-widget>`.

Number values can also be captured by the :ref:`range-widgets`.

.. _default-integer-widget:

Integer widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``integer``
appearance
  *none*


A whole number entry input.

Integer widgets will not accept decimal points,
and the entry field has a limit of nine digits.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``decimal``
appearance
  *none*

A numeric input that will accept decimal points.

Decimal number entry is capped at 15 characters
(14 digits and a decimal point).
If you need numbers larger than 15 digits,
see the :ref:`number-text-widget`.

The decimal widget supports:

- :ref:`Thousands separators <thousands-sep>`

If ``thousands-sep`` is added to ``appearance``,
:ref:`integer <default-integer-widget>`,
:ref:`decimal <default-decimal-widget>`,
and :ref:`number text <number-text-widget>` widgets
will display their values using locale-specific thousands separators.

.. note::

  For locales that use the point separator (``.``),
  a space is used instead.

.. _time-widget:

Time widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``time``
appearance
  *none*

A time selector. Captures only a specific time-of-day, not a date and time. For date and time, see the :ref:`datetime-widget`.

The time widget does not accept any ``appearance`` attributes.

.. note::
  :name: time-zone-note


  The time widget stores the time along with a time zone.
  This can cause unexpected behavior around `Daylight saving time`_.

  .. _Daylight saving time: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time

  For example, if you record a time before the clock change,
  and then view the time after the clock change,
  it will appear to be an hour off.
  This happens because the recorded time data
  is understood as a specific moment in time
  that is being "translated" into your current, local time zone.

  A similar problem occurs when moving between geographic time zones.

  This makes the time widget unsuitable for abstract
  time-of-day questions such as *What time do you usually wake up?*
  For questions like this, you may want to use a :ref:`select-minimal`.
  You can set the options at whatever level of accuracy you need ---
  for example, 15 or 30 minute increments.
  Alternatively, you could use the select widget for hours,
  and an :ref:`default-integer-widget` for minutes.

.. _select-widgets:

Select widgets
-----------------

Select widgets display choices to pick from. Single selects allow selecting a :ref:`single choice <single-select-widget>`, and multi selects allow :ref:`selecting multiple choices <multi-select-widget>`.

The choices for a select question can be included on a sheet named **choices** directly in an XLSForm or attached as an :ref:`external dataset <select-from-external-dataset>`.

The order of the choices can be :ref:`randomized <randomize-choice-order>` for any of the select types described below. The list of choices available can also be :ref:`filtered <cascading-selects>` based on answers to previous questions. Selects from internal datasets can :ref:`include images as choices <select-columns-widget>`.

Selects can be displayed in different ways using :ref:`appearances <select-appearances>`.

The **choices** sheet for defining internal datasets has at least three columns:

``list_name``
  A set of choices for a single question share a common ``list_name``.
  The value of ``list_name`` is included in the ``type`` column
  on the **survey** sheet.

``name``
  The identifier for a specific choice. This value is what is stored on the completed form. If you :ref:`refer to a select response using a variable <variables>`, the ``name`` string is returned.

  As in the **survey** sheet, the ``name`` for a choice must not include spaces.

``label``
  The user-facing text displayed for the choice.

.. _select-from-external-dataset:

Select from external dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data files in CSV, GeoJSON or XML format can be attached to form definitions. These :doc:`external datasets <form-datasets>` can be used as data sources for selects. The question type for single selection is ``select_one_from_file`` and for multiple selection, it is ``select_multiple_from_file``. The full filename of the dataset including the extension goes after the type.

Selects from external datasets can be used in all the same ways as internal selects. For example, they can be displayed differently using :ref:`appearances <select-appearances>` or filtered using :ref:`choice filters <cascading-selects>`.

Customizing the label and value
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

When using an :doc:`external dataset <form-datasets>` as a data source for a select, the underlying value for each choice comes from:

- GeoJSON file: the ``id`` top-level element if it exists or the ``id`` property as a fallback
- XML file: the ``name`` child element

The label for each choice comes from:

- CSV file: the ``label`` column
- GeoJSON file: the ``title`` property (follows `the GeoJSON simplestyle specification <https://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec/tree/master/1.1.0>`_)
- XML file: the ``label`` child element

In some cases, it may not be convenient to rename your columns to match these defaults. If you have a dataset from another source and different column names, you can use the ``parameters`` column in your XLSForm to specify which columns to use.

For example, to use ``feature_id`` for the underlying value and ``human_name`` for the label:

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, name, label, parameters

  select_one_from_file hospitals.csv,hospital,Select hospital,"value=feature_id,label=human_name"

.. csv-table:: hospitals.csv
  :header: feature_id, human_name

  hospital_a,Hospital A
  hospital_b,Hospital B

.. _select-appearances:

Select appearances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selects can be styled in various ways using the ``appearance`` column in an XLSForm. Unless otherwise indicated, the appearances described below can combine with single or multiple selects with either internal or external data sources.

.. _select-minimal:

Minimal select widget
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

type
  ``select_one {list_name}``
appearance
  ``minimal``

Adding the ``minimal`` appearance shows the choices in a compact way. This is particularly helpful when the list of choices is long and the select question is displayed on :ref:`the same screen as other questions <field-list>`. It is often combined with :ref:`the autocomplete appearance <select-autocomplete>`.

.. image:: /img/form-question-types/select-one-minimal-start.*
  :alt: The Single Select form widget, with minimal appearance, as displayed in the ODK Collect app on an Android phone. The question text is "Select widget." The hint text is "select_one type with minimal appearance, 4 text choices." Below that is a drop-down style select menu with the prompt "Select One Answer." Above the question text is the form group name "Select one widgets."

  ``quick``

When the ``quick`` appearance is added,
the form advances immediately to the next question
once a selection is made.

.. note::
    The `quick` appearance can only be used with single selection.

.. _select-autocomplete:

Select widget with autocomplete
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

type
  ``select_one {list_name}``

  ``autocomplete``

The ``autocomplete`` appearance allows the enumerator to filter the list of available choices based on their label. The filtering is case-insensitive and matches any subset of the label text.

.. image:: /img/form-question-types/select-autocomplete.*
  :alt: The Select One form widget with autocomplete, as displayed in the ODK Collect app on an Android phone. The question text is "Select one widget."

.. _select-columns-pack-widget:

Select widget with columns-pack appearance
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

type
  ``select_one {list_name}``
appearance
  *columns-pack*

When the ``columns-pack`` appearance is added, the app tries to accommodate as many choices in a single line as possible. If the choice labels have different lengths, they will not be in even columns.

.. image:: /img/form-question-types/select-columns-pack.*

  opt_abcd,d,D


.. _select-columns-widget:

Select widget with columns appearance
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

type
  ``select_one {list_name}``
appearance
  ``columns``

When the ``columns`` appearance is added, the app puts choices in 2, 3, 4 or 5 columns depending on the screen size.

Select widgets support image choices.
The images are referenced in the **choices** sheet,
and the image files
need to be included in the :file:`media` folder.

See :ref:`image-options` to learn more about including images in surveys.

.. _select-no-buttons-widget:

Select widget with no-buttons appearance
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

type
  ``select_one {list_name}``
appearance
  ``no-buttons``

When the ``no-buttons`` appearance is added, the app displays choices without the selection radio button. If images are specified for choices, only the images are displayed. This is particularly useful for building a grid of images.

  `ODK Collect v2023.1.0 <https://github.com/getodk/collect/releases/tag/v2023.1.0>`_

type
 ``select_one {list_name}``
appearance
 ``map``

.. warning::
  The `map` appearance on selects is not yet available in web forms (Enketo).

  The different :ref:`basemap sources <mapping-settings>` currently have different performance. If Collect feels slow when creating the map or when selecting a choice, please describe what you are experiencing `on the forum <https://forum.getodk.org/c/support/6>`_. If you have many choices to include on a map, try a provider other than Google or Mapbox. You can also use a :ref:`choice filter <cascading-selects>` to reduce the number of choices that get mapped.

.. note::
    The only appearance that can combine with selection from map is `quick`.

If the choices that you want users to select from are locations, you can display them on a map. Each choice must have a ``geometry`` property that specifies the choice's geometry (see :ref:`Specifying geometry for choices <specify-select-geometry>` for details). A choice list can include a mix of points, lines and shapes.

.. image:: /img/form-question-types/select-from-map-point.*
  :alt: Single select from map as displayed in the ODK Collect app on an Android phone. The question text is "Select a point" and it is displayed in a small top bar. Below that is a map with several markers. One of the markers is larger. At the bottom of the screen, there is information about the selected marker. Its label is "Restaurant Délicia". Several other properties are shown including `timestamp`, `version` and `amenity`. Below the properties, there is a rounded button with a save icon and the text "Select."
  :class: device-screen-vertical

Below the properties, there is a rounded button with a save icon and the text "Select."
  :class: device-screen-vertical

.. _specify-select-geometry:

Specifying geometry for choices
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
You can specify geometry for all choice sources:

#. If you specify choices in the form using the **choices** tab, add a ``geometry`` column
#. If you use an :ref:`external CSV file <selects-from-csv>` and use ``select_one_from_file``, add a ``geometry`` column
#. Use a :ref:`GeoJSON attachment <selects-from-geojson>` and ``select_one_from_file``

For the first two options, geometry values must be specified in :ref:`the ODK format <location-widgets>`. This makes it straightforward to use data previously collected by ODK as choices displayed on a map. You must make sure that the column containing the geometry to use for each choice has the name ``geometry``.

Learn more about using GeoJSON attachments and see an example :ref:`here <selects-from-geojson>`.

.. note::
    Choices with invalid geometries are silently ignored. There will be no message displayed to a user when it happens.

Select one from map behavior
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When the map is first opened, it centers on the device's current location. There are buttons on the right to recenter on the current location and to show all available points.

Point choices are represented by map markers (:fa:`map-marker`). Tapping on a marker increases its size.

Line and polygon choices are represented by red lines. The inside of polygons is shaded red and can be tapped to select the polygon.

When a choice is selected, its properties are displayed at the bottom of the screen. Those properties are from:

- additional columns when choices are specified the **choices** tab or an :ref:`external CSV file <selects-from-csv>`
- the ``properties`` object when choices are specified in a GeoJSON file

Under the choice label, there is a button to save the currently-selected feature to the form.

Choice properties
''''''''''''''''''

All of a choice's properties including ``geometry`` can be used in the rest of the form (see :ref:`referencing values in datasets <referencing-values-in-datasets>`) including in :ref:`choice filter <cascading-selects>` expressions. Even if the choices are specified from a GeoJSON file, the ``geometry`` property is made available to the form in :ref:`the ODK format <location-widgets>`, NOT as GeoJSON.

There are special properties that can be used to style different choices:

- Points

  - **marker-color**: a valid long or short hex color representing the color of a marker (e.g. ``#aaccee`` or ``#ace``).
  - **marker-symbol**: a single character displayed on a marker (e.g. ``A`` or ``7`` or ``🏥`` or ``🟢``).

- Lines

  - **stroke**: a valid long or short hex color representing the color of a line (e.g. ``#aaccee`` or ``#ace``).
  - **stroke-width**: a floating-point number (greater than or equal to 0) representing the width of a line (e.g. ``5`` or ``6.5``).

- Polygons

  - **stroke**: a valid long or short hex color representing the color of a polygon (e.g. ``#aaccee`` or ``#ace``).
  - **stroke-width**: a floating-point number (greater than or equal to 0) representing the width of a polygon (e.g. ``5`` or ``6.5``).
  - **fill**: a valid long or short hex color representing the interior color of a polygon (e.g. ``#aaccee`` or ``#ace``). It is displayed with transparency that can't be configured. 

If your geospatial data comes from an external source, you can :ref:`customize the label and underlying value <customizing-label-and-value>`.

If there is an :doc:`offline layer <collect-offline-maps>` specified, it will be displayed under the mapped choices. 

.. _image-map-select:

Select from image widget
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

type
  ``select_one {list_name}``, ``select_multiple {list-name}``
appearance
  ``image-map``

The image map widget displays an `SVG`_ image with selectable regions.

.. _SVG: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics

To make an image with selectable regions:

#. Create or edit an :file:`.svg` source file. Include ``id`` attributes on any elements you want to be selectable.
#. In the **choices** tab of your XLSForm, put the value of the ``id`` attributes in the ``name`` column. Add an appropriate human-friendly ``label`` to each choice.
#. In the **survey** tab of your XLSForm, put the :file:`.svg` file name in the ``image`` column.
#. Include the :file:`.svg` file :ref:`in your form's media folder <loading-form-media>`.

.. _image-options:

Including media files in choices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like :ref:`question labels <media>`, choices can include media (image, video, or audio files):

.. csv-table:: choices
  :header: list_name, name, label, image, video, audio

  opt_media,a,A,a.jpg
  opt_media,b,B,,b.mp4
  opt_media,c,C,,,c.mp3

.. seealso:: :ref:`Best practices for images <label-images-best-practices>` and :ref:`selects with images in Web Forms <web-forms-selects-images>`

.. note::

  For images, you can :ref:`specify a bigger image for panning and zooming <big-image>` using the ``big-image`` column. This is not compatible with the ``no-buttons`` appearance.

  ``select_one`` and ``select_multiple`` questions using the ``no-buttons`` appearances will not
  display media buttons next to choices. However, if a choice has audio, it will be played when
  the choice is selected.

.. _randomize-choice-order:

Randomizing choice order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To reduce bias, choice order can be randomized for any of the select question types described above. To display the choices in a different order each time the question is displayed, set **randomize** to **true** in the ``parameters`` column of the XLSForm **survey** sheet:

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, parameters, name, label

  select_one opt_abcd,randomize=true,select_one_random_widget,"Select one with random choice order set on each display"

.. csv-table:: choices
  :header: list_name, name, label

  opt_abcd,a,A
  opt_abcd,b,B
  opt_abcd,c,C
  opt_abcd,d,D

In the example above, each time the question is displayed, the choices will be in a different order. This means a single data collector may see the same question with different choice orders if they open a draft or leave the question and then return to it.

Seeded randomization
""""""""""""""""""""

It can be preferable to show a consistent order for choices for a given submission. This can be accomplished by setting an integer seed for the randomization. Using an explicit seed also allows you to recreate the order that choices were displayed in at analysis time to do things like identify biasing orders.

Good seed values are unique to a submission. Some examples are the unique ID of a participant or the last 4 digits of a phone number. Another good option is to use time.

In the example below, the current time is converted to a decimal number. The number before the decimal point is the number of days since January 1, 1970. The digits after the decimal point represent fractions of a day from midnight. This means that the digits after the decimal point will be different for each form session and are a good candidate for a random seed. To use only that part of the time representation, we can use the :func:`substr` function.

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, parameters, name, label, calculation

  calculate,,my_seed,,"once(substr(decimal-date-time(now()), 8))"
  select_one opt_abcd,"randomize=true,seed=${my_seed}",select_one_widget,Select one with random choice order set once per filled form

.. csv-table:: choices
  :header: list_name, name, label

  opt_abcd,a,A
  opt_abcd,b,B
  opt_abcd,c,C
  opt_abcd,d,D

To recreate the order that choices were displayed in from the seed, see `the XForms spec <https://getodk.github.io/xforms-spec/#fn:randomize>`_ for a description of the randomization algorithm used.

.. note::

  If you use a changing value like time in your seed expression, :func:`once` is important because it makes sure the seed is not changed if the same filled form is opened more than once.

.. _or-other:

Including "other" as a choice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

  We do not recommend using ``or_other`` because it does not support multiple languages or ``choice_filter``. Instead, add your own "other" question and use form logic to have it appear as needed.

On the **survey** sheet, in the ``type`` column,
after the type and the list_name,
you can add ``or_other``.
This will add "Other" as an additional option to your choice list.
The ``name`` value of the choice when selected will be ``other``.


.. _rank-widget:

Rank widget
-----------------

The rank widget allows the user to order options from a list. The value saved in the form and sent to the server is a space-separated ordered list of the options.

Like with :ref:`select-widgets`, the options are listed on a sheet named **choices** in an XLSForm.

To change the order of the options in the list, tap the :guilabel:`Rank items` button. In the resulting dialog, long press on an item and once it gets a border around it, drag it up or down to change the order. If no :ref:`default <default-responses>` is provided, the value for the question is blank until the user taps :guilabel:`OK` in the ranking dialog.

To limit the options in the rank widget based on the answer to a previous question, specify an expression in the :ref:`choice_filter <cascading-selects>` column of the **survey** sheet.

.. _location-widgets:

Capturing geospatial data
--------------------------

Geospatial question types make it possible to capture one or more points representing locations on Earth. Each point is represented as four numbers separated by spaces: latitude, longitude, altitude in meters, and accuracy radius in meters.

For example, if a Collect user captured a point while at the coordinates 12°22'17.0"N 1°31'10.9"W, with a reported accuracy radius of 17.4 meters, and at 305 meters above sea level, the ODK ``geopoint`` representation would be:

`12.371400 -1.519700 305 17.4`

Multiple points that form lines or shapes are separated by semicolons and called ``geotrace`` and ``geoshape``.

.. seealso::

  ..  youtube:: duDMw1aHCkw
    :width: 100%

.. note::

  The accuracy radius is an estimate of what Android calls the `radius of 68% confidence <https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Location.html#getAccuracy()>`_: there is a 68% chance that the true location falls within this radius. This is an estimate reported by the Android system based on the available sensors (GPS, network, etc). The accuracy radius itself may be more or less reliable depending on the sensor(s) used and current conditions.

  To get an accurate location quickly, ensure devices have a clear view of the sky. For even faster points, consider "warming" the GPS with a :ref:`start-geopoint <metadata-start-geopoint>` question. See :doc:`improving location performance <collect-location>` for more.

.. _mock-location:

Mock location providers and external GPS devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Android makes it possible to provide mock locations to applications like ODK Collect. This can be useful for testing with real geo data without needing to go to a specific location. You can use applications like `Fake GPS <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lexa.fakegps&hl=en_US>`_ for this. 

GPS faker applications can also be used by enumerators, presenting a risk to data quality. ODK Collect makes this detectable by always setting the accuracy to 0 when a location comes from a mock location provider. If you see an accuracy of 0 in analysis, the corresponding point came either from manual point placement or from a mock provider.

External GPS devices also use mock location providers. When using an external GPS device, you should configure your form to capture accuracy even when it comes from a mock provider. To do this, set **allow-mock-accuracy** to **true** in the **parameters** column of your geospatial question in your XLSForm **survey** sheet. See :ref:`the section on geopoint <geopoint-widget>` for an example.

If you rely on mock locations, keep in mind that only GPS can be spoofed. The system may still retrieve real location data from WI-FI or cellular networks, which can override the mock location and as a result, deliver a mix of real and fake location data. To avoid this, go to ``Android Settings`` > ``Location`` and turn off ``Improve location accuracy``. This forces the device to use only GPS, ensuring your mock location is applied consistently.

.. _geopoint-widget:

Geopoint widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``geopoint``
appearance
  *none*

Captures the current geolocation from the device. The location is displayed in degrees-minutes-seconds (DMS) notation and is stored in `decimal degrees <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees>`_ with altitude and accuracy. Learn more about the format of resulting data in :ref:`the location widgets section <location-widgets>`.

This question type shows a dialog with the current accuracy and lets the data collector decide when to capture the point. For capturing location without data collector intervention, see :ref:`start-geopoint <metadata-start-geopoint>`. For a geopoint with a user-selected location, see :ref:`placement-map <placement-map-widget>`.

.. _accuracy-constraint:

.. tip::

  You can use :func:`selected-at()` to require geopoints meet a particular threshold. For example, if you need points with an accuracy better than 10 meters, use this constraint:

  `selected-at(${geopoint_widget}, 3) < 10`.

  The ``3`` in the above constraint references accuracy, the fourth space-separated value in the `geopoint data type <https://getodk.github.io/xforms-spec/#data-types>`_. The `selected-at` function uses 0-based indexing so you can use ``0`` to reference latitude, ``1`` for longitude, and ``2`` for altitude.

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, name, label, hint, parameters

  geopoint,geopoint_widget,Geopoint widget,geopoint type,capture-accuracy=10 warning-accuracy=10 allow-mock-accuracy=true 

There are three parameters that can be used to customize a ``geopoint`` question's behavior:

``capture-accuracy``: when the device accuracy reaches this value or better, the point will be automatically captured and the dialog will close. If you always want data collectors to make an explicit decision about accepting a point, set this value to 0. Defaults to 5 (meters), a target that can usually be reached by modern devices given enough time. We generally do not recommend setting this value to below 3 (meters) unless you are using an external GPS device. You can also :ref:`set an accuracy constraint <accuracy-constraint>`.

``warning-accuracy``: when the device accuracy is this value or worse, the dialog is red and displays a message stating that the accuracy is unacceptable. There is no enforcement of the threshold so if a data collector needs to capture a point with an unacceptable accuracy (e.g. because they can't wait any longer), they can do so. Set this value to the same value as ``capture-accuracy`` if you generally always want your data collectors to wait until the point is automatically captured. Defaults to 100 (meters), about the length of a city block. In extreme conditions such as under dense forest canopy, any reported accuracy may be considered acceptable. In that case, you can set this value to a very large number.

``allow-mock-accuracy``: set to ``true`` to use an external GPS device that uses the mock GPS provider. Otherwise, any location captured from a mock provider will have an accuracy of 0.

A dialog is used to give data collectors feedback on the location they are capturing:

.. image:: /img/form-question-types/geopoint-dialog.*
  :class: device-screen-vertical

The dialog is designed to guide the data collector to capture a point with the best reported accuracy possible. The current accuracy is shown at the top of the dialog (1). A message below it (2) gives a qualitative assessment of the accuracy (e.g. unacceptable, poor) and suggested action (e.g. wait). The progress bar (3) gives a visual representation of progress towards an acceptable accuracy.

The bottom half of the dialog displays troubleshooting information. The first line (4) shows the accuracy at which the point will be automatically captured. This is configured by the ``capture-accuracy`` parameter. You can ask data collectors to watch time elapsed (5) and let you know if it is systematically taking them a long time to get high-accuracy points. This may indicate an issue with their device.

You can also train data collectors to use time elapsed to take some action. For example, you can let them know to capture any point available after waiting for 2 minutes. Number of satellites (6) can be useful when capturing points outdoors. A low number of satellites (under 4) may indicate that something is wrong with the device or its position. See :doc:`collect-location`.

.. tip::

  If you rely on mock locations, keep in mind that only GPS can be spoofed. The system may still retrieve real location data from WI-FI or cellular networks, which can override the mock location and as a result, deliver a mix of real and fake location data. To avoid this, go to ``Android Settings`` > ``Location`` and turn off ``Improve location accuracy``. This forces the device to use only GPS, ensuring your mock location is applied consistently.


.. _geopoint-maps:

Geopoint with map display
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

type
  ``geopoint``
appearance
  ``maps``

The default :ref:`geopoint-widget` does not display a map to the user. When the appearance attribute is ``maps``, the widget displays a map to help the user get oriented and confirm that the selected point is correct and sufficiently accurate.

When the device's geolocation is available, it is displayed on the map by a blue cross. A blue shaded circle around the cross represents the accuracy radius of the geolocation. The "add marker" button at the top right of the screen can be tapped to add a point at the location indicated by the middle of the blue cross. The selected point is represented by a small circle with a red outline.

When the map view is opened again with a selected point, the map is centered on that point. To change the selection, first tap the "trash" icon and then select a new point.

For a geopoint with a location that the user can manually select or adjust, see :ref:`placement-map-widget`.

.. _placement-map-widget:

Geopoint with user-selected location
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

type
  ``geopoint``
appearance
  ``placement-map``

The default :ref:`geopoint-widget` does not allow the user to place the point anywhere other than the device's current geolocation.

A geopoint with the appearance attribute ``placement-map`` allows the user to select any point from a map. The user can either long press to place the point anywhere, or, if the device knows its geolocation, tap on the "add point" button at the top right of the screen. The selected point is represented by a small circle with a red outline (see arrow in screenshot).

The save button saves the selected point and returns to the question screen. If the point was selected by long pressing, the accuracy radius and altitude will both be 0. If the device's geolocation was selected, the accuracy radius will be greater than 0.

When the map view is opened again with an existing point, the map is centered on the selected point. To change the selection, first tap the "trash" icon and then select a new point.

.. _geotrace-widget:

Geotrace widget
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``geotrace``
appearance
  *none*

A series of points. Identical to :ref:`geoshape <geoshape-widget>` except that the first and last point may be different and at least 2 points are required.

Points can be entered either by tapping the screen to place each point, or by taking readings of the device's geolocation over time. On a map, each coordinate is represented by small circles with red outlines. These are connected by red lines.

To collect a geotrace, first select the location-recording mode by tapping the "add point" button in the upper right side of the screen. The selected mode will be displayed in the gray bar at the bottom of the screen. While point collection is ongoing, the "add marker" button changes to a "pause" button. The "back arrow" button can be used to remove the last-entered point either when actively collecting points or when paused. Any point can be manually moved at any time by tapping on it and dragging it. The mode can only be changed if an existing line is first cleared by tapping the "trash" button. Recording must be paused to clear the existing line.

.. tip::
  Points that were entered by tapping or adjusted by dragging will always have an accuracy radius of 0. Points that were read from the device location will never have an accuracy radius of 0.

Once the trace has been saved, the coordinates of its points will be displayed on the question screen. The trace can be opened for manual editing by tapping to add more points, moving existing points or deleting the last-added point. After a trace has been saved once, it cannot be added to in manual or automatic location recording modes.

The three location recording modes are:

Placement by tapping
  The user taps the device to place points.

Manual location recording
  The user chooses when to tap the "record a point" button at the top of the screen to capture the device geolocation at that moment.

Automatic location recording
  The user is prompted to select a recording interval and accuracy requirement. If the accuracy requirement is set to None, points are always collected at the recording interval. If the accuracy requirement is set to any other value, a point will only be captured if it meets the requirement. For example, given a recording interval of 20 seconds and an accuracy requirement of 10 meters, the app places a point at the device location every 20 seconds if the location is accurate to 10 meters or better.

.. warning::

  If you are using Aggregate and you would like to collect more than 5 points at a time, you should :doc:`increase the database field length to over 255 characters <aggregate-field-length>`. Otherwise, additional points will be lost.

A series of points that form a closed polygon. Identical to :ref:`geotrace <geotrace-widget>` except that the first and last point are always the same and at least 3 points are required.

Points can be entered either by tapping the screen to place each point, or by taking readings of the device's geolocation over time. On a map, each coordinate is represented by small circles with red outlines. These are connected by red lines.

To collect a geoshape, first select the location-recording mode by tapping the "add point" button in the upper right side of the screen. The selected mode will be displayed in the gray bar at the bottom of the screen. While point collection is ongoing, the "add marker" button changes to a "pause" button.

Any point can be manually moved at any time by tapping on it and dragging it. The mode can only be changed if an existing line is first cleared by tapping the "trash" button. Recording must be paused to clear the existing line.

.. tip::
  Points that were entered by tapping or adjusted by dragging will always have an accuracy radius of 0. Points that were read from the device location will never have an accuracy radius of 0.

Once the shape has been saved, the coordinates of its points will be displayed on the question screen. The shape can be opened for manual editing by tapping to add more points, moving existing points or deleting the last-added point. After a shape has been saved once, it cannot be added to in manual or automatic location recording modes.

The three location recording modes are:

Adding the ``annotate`` appearance allows the user to draw on the image before submitting it.

.. tip::
  If you have a standard image to annotate, you can add that image's filename in the ``default`` column. For example, put ``template.png`` in the ``default`` column and Central will prompt you to attach a png to the form. Anyone who fills out the form will see the same image.

  To enforce that this default image gets annotated, you can use a constraint such as `not(. = 'jr://images/template.png'))`. This works because Collect renames images after annotation.

Scaling down images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Images created with any of the image widgets described above can be automatically scaled down on save by using the ``max-pixels`` parameter. If the long edge of the image is larger than the maximum size specified, the image is resized proportionally so that the long edge matches the provided pixel value. This is useful to reduce the upload size when bandwidth is limited.

.. warning::

  All scaled down jpg images are saved with 80% quality. That means in some rare cases when:

  - a jpg image is attached not captured
  - and the attached file has quality lower than 80%
  - and the difference between its original size and the value specified using ``max-pixels`` is not big enough 

  the size of the output image might be even bigger that the original one.

Available in Collect since v1.10.0 and in XLSForm since 7/2018.

The built-in audio recorder makes it possible to capture audio without having to install an external app.

It also enables recording while filling out other questions and is designed to continue recording even if the user switches to another app or if the phone screen is locked.

.. image:: /img/form-question-types/built-in-recorder.*
  :alt: The built-in recorder as displayed in the ODK Collect App on an Android phone. The user interface is described below.
  :class: device-screen-vertical

When built-in audio recording is enabled and recording is initiated, a recording control bar appears at at the top of the screen. At the top left of this bar is an icon to represent whether recording is currently ongoing or paused (1). To the right of this icon is the current length of the recording (2).

.. warning::

  Pause is only available on Android 7.0 and above. On lower Android versions, the pause button is hidden.

At the right of the control bar are a pause button (3) and a stop button (4). When the pause button is tapped, recording is temporarily suspended and the button icon changes to a microphone. When the microphone is tapped, recording is resumed. Recording can be paused and resumed as many times as desired. When the stop button is tapped, the recording is ended and can no longer be modified.

Recording status is also displayed below the audio question text. There is a time representing the current length of the recording (5) and a diagram (6) representing the volume of the recording over time. The diagram provides confirmation that the microphone is working and can help a user ensure an even, sufficient volume.

Other questions can be included on the same screen as a built-in recording question. As shown in the screenshot above, this makes it possible to capture quantitative content while recording. To achieve this, put the questions in a :ref:`field list <field-list>`.

During recording, the user is prevented from leaving the current question screen. However, it is safe to use other applications or to lock the device screen.

Once recording is stopped, the control bar disappears. The recording is made available for playback below the question text.

To replace the audio captured, first delete the current file and then record again.

In some rare cases such as the device running out of space, the recording may complete successfully but not be attached to the form. If this happens, a dialog will be displayed explaining that the file is available but needs to be accessed manually. You can find these files in the ``recordings`` folder of the :ref:`Collect directory <collect-directory>`. This folder is never cleared so consider emptying it yourself once you have retrieved its files.

.. _customizing-audio-quality:

Customizing audio quality
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 1.29

  `ODK Collect v1.29.0 <https://github.com/getodk/collect/releases/tag/v1.29.0>`_, Central v1.1.0.

The quality of audio recordings can be customized using the ``quality`` parameter. If a ``quality`` is specified, the built-in recorder is always used, regardless of Collect settings. If no ``quality`` is specified and :ref:`external app recording has been disabled <use-external-app-for-audio-recording>`, ``normal`` is used. The available quality values are:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Value
     - Extension
     - Encoding
     - Bit rate
     - Sample rate
     - File size
   * - normal
     - .m4a
     - AAC
     - 64 kbps
     - 32 kHz
     - ~30 MB/hour
   * - low
     - .m4a
     - AAC
     - 24 kbps
     - 32 kHz
     - ~11 MB/hour
   * - voice-only
     - .amr
     - AMR
     - 12.2 kbps
     - 8 kHz
     - ~5 MB/hour

.. tip::

  We'd recommend only using ``voice-only`` for one-on-one interviews in a quiet place as otherwise there might be too much detail loss. ``low`` will sound compressed but speech is generally intelligible, even if multiple people are talking at once. ``normal`` is similar to typical podcast settings and will sound good on most devices.

  It's a good idea to test the different qualities out with the device (and any other equipment) you'll be using in the field to see which one fits your use case and setup best.

.. rubric:: XLSForm

In the parameters column, write ``quality=`` followed by the desired value.

.. csv-table:: survey
 :header: type, name, label, parameters

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If it's a possibility that an individual question could need different qualities depending on context you can use :ref:`relevance <relevants>` to switch between them:

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, name, label, parameters, relevance

  select_one yes_no, is_quiet, Are you currently in a quiet location with only one person speaking at a time?

  audio, recording_voice_only, Please record, quality=voice-only, ${is_quiet} = 'yes'

.. _external-audio-app:

Recording with an external app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type
  ``audio``
appearance
  ``none``
parameters
  ``quality=external``

Setting ``quality`` to ``external`` will cause Collect to use an external app to record audio rather than the built-in recorder. You can also :ref:`configure Collect to always use an external app for recording <use-external-app-for-audio-recording>` and set no ``quality`` parameter.

Some Android devices provide a default application for audio recording. Others do not, and the user will need to install an audio recording app.

Any app that responds to
``android.provider.MediaStore.Audio.Media.RECORD_SOUND_ACTION``
should be compatible. We recommend `Axet Audio Recorder <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.axet.audiorecorder>`_.


.. _external-app-audio-widget:

  It is recommended not to make barcode questions required because even when using high quality and waterproof codes things can go wrong and some of them might be unreadable for the camera. To handle such cases, it might be a good idea to add a :ref:`text-default` as a fallback option to let enumerators enter the code manually.

Hiding the scanned value
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the scanned value is shown below the widget button. In some cases, the raw scanned value is not helpful to display. For example, it may be base64-encoded, be very long, or may represent a list of values. In that case, you can use the ``hidden-answer`` appearance. We generally recommend putting this question in a :ref:`field-list <field-list>` to provide some useful feedback about the scanned value.

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, name, label, appearance, calculation

  begin_group,gr,,field-list

.. _print-widget:

Printer widget
------------------

.. note::
  Collect previously supported printing to specific Zebra label printer modules with an external app. That external app is no longer available and starting in Collect v2024.1, this more general print functionality replaces it.

type
  ``text``
appearance
  ``printer``

When a ``text`` field has the ``printer`` appearance, its text value is interpreted as HTML by ODK Collect. When the user taps the ``Print`` button, Collect shows a print preview of that rendered HTML. From the preview screen, users can save as PDF or send to a connected printer.

.. image:: /img/form-question-types/print.*

.. rubric:: XLSForm

.. csv-table:: survey
  :header: type, name, label, appearance, calculation

   text,id_card,Tap the button to print the card,printer,"concat(${first_name}, ' ', ${last_name})"

The most common way to set the value to print is by specifying a ``calculate`` expression, generally with the :func:`concat` function so that values from the form can be included.

We recommend writing your HTML with fixed sample values first, trying it in a web browser, and then converting it to a concat function to insert form values. You don't need to include ``body`` tags and other aspects typically required in an web page, you can instead specify only the elements that you need.

This question type understands a custom ``qrcode`` element. Any text values placed within opening and closing ``qrcode`` tags will be encoded as a QR code and shown as an image You can apply the same attributes and styling to this element as you would to an ``img`` element.

The calculation used to generate the card in the screenshot above is::
   
  concat("
    <qrcode width='150' height='150'>", ${first_name}, " ", ${last_name}, " ", ${age}, " ", ${email}, " ", ${phone_number}, "</qrcode></br>
    <img width='150' src='", ${photo}, "'>

To do this, put your select questions in a ``field-list`` group and use the following ``appearance`` attributes:

``label``
  Only the option labels are displayed, without checkboxes. This is used for the top row with the 'Yes' and 'No' options in the example above.
``list-nolabel``
  Only checkboxes or radio buttons are displayed, without their labels. This is used for the question rows in the example above.
``list``
  The labels are displayed along with checkboxes for multi-select questions and radio buttons for single-select questions. You could use this instead of having a ``label`` row to keep the option labels closer to the checkboxes or radio buttons.

Hidden questions
------------------

Not all question types render as visible widgets in Collect. Hidden fields collect and store values which are accessible as :ref:`variables <variables>` and available in :doc:`Central <central-intro>` and other data analysis tools.

.. _metadata:

Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~

Metadata questions capture information about the device or a survey collection event and are not visible to the user.

.. warning:: ``start``, ``end``, and ``today`` rely on device time. Depending on the device hardware, operating system, clock configuration, network configuration, the device time can be wrong. To reliably measure the time between events (e.g., to know how long a survey took) or to get a more complete record of user behavior within a form, consider using :doc:`form audit logging <form-audit-log>`.

These items are dependent on the survey collection event:

- ``start`` --- The datetime the survey was started in ISO 8601 format (e.g., 2019-09-27T09:45:10.854-07:00).
- ``end`` --- The last datetime the survey was saved in ISO 8601 format.
- ``today`` --- The date the survey was started in ISO 8601 format (e.g, 2019-09-27).
- ``start-geopoint`` --- The geolocation when the survey was started. :ref:`Read more <metadata-start-geopoint>`.

This item is defined at installation time and cannot be changed:

- ``deviceid`` --- A unique, randomly generated 16-character alphanumeric identifier (prefixed with ``collect::``) that is tied to a specific installation of the app. It remains constant across all projects and forms within ODK Collect. This identifier is an internal feature of ODK Collect, inaccessible to other applications or external sources on the device. The only way to change it is by reinstalling the app.

These items are defined in Collect,
and :ref:`can be edited in Settings <form-metadata-settings>`:

- ``username``
- ``phonenumber``

Geolocation at survey start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. seealso::
  :ref:`Audit log geolocation tracking <form-audit-geolocation-tracking>`

.. note::
  Geolocation at survey start was added in Collect v1.23 and Central v1.0.0.

The ``start-geopoint`` question type is used to capture a single geolocation in :ref:`geopoint format <location-widgets>` when the survey is first started. Questions of type ``start-geopoint`` may be given any allowable name. Although it is possible to have more than one ``start-geopoint`` question in a form, all will have the same value. You can also capture location in the background when a question's value changes using :ref:`background-geopoint <question-type-background-geopoint>`.

Any time a survey with a ``start-geopoint`` question is opened in Collect, the enumerator will see a warning that the form tracks device location. If the device battery is low, or if location tracking needs to be turned off for any reason, you can tap :menuselection:`⋮ --> Track location` or turn off location providers in Android.

The first time that a survey with a ``start-geopoint`` question is opened, Collect will attempt to read the device's geolocation. The geolocation reading with the highest accuracy received in a 20-second window will be recorded. A location icon will be displayed in the Android status bar while the geolocation is being requested by Collect.

Geolocation is read using data from GPS, WiFi and possibly other signals so this feature should work in most environments.

If geolocation information is unavailable, the question will be left blank. Reasons for a blank value may include the enumerator turning off location providers, Collect not having location permissions, Google Play Services not being installed, the GPS not having satellite lock and more. No troubleshooting information is provided in the form submission.

Including a ``start-geopoint`` question may make it faster to get high-accuracy geolocation readings for other :ref:`location question types <location-widgets>` by "warming" the GPS.

When a form includes a question of type ``background-audio``, audio is recorded while the form is open and attached to the form submission as a single audio file. These recordings can be used for quality assurance, training, transcription, and more. Use background recording instead of an :ref:`audio question <customizing-audio-quality>` when you want to make sure to record everything that happens during form filling.

By default, audio files will be saved in the `amr` format with a bitrate of 12.2 kbps and a sample rate of 8 kHz, resulting in a file size of about 5 MB per hour. These settings correspond to the ``voice-only`` quality :ref:`for audio questions <customizing-audio-quality>` and minimize file size while maintaining reasonable quality for a conversation between two people. You can override that default quality by specifying a value in the ``parameters`` column as described :ref:`for audio questions <customizing-audio-quality>`.

Planning for background audio recording
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Before adding background audio recording to your form, make sure that you have a plan for following local laws around audio recording. We generally recommend including a note at the beginning of the form to remind data collectors and participants that they are being recorded and to describe the purpose of the recording. Depending on the context, you may be required to ask for the consent of every person in speaking range of the microphone.

Additionally, you should make a plan for using the resulting audio files. Do you have someone who can listen to and make sense of many audio files? Could you get access to speech-to-text capabilities? Also consider whether your data collectors will be able to send audio files. Will they have access to a fast enough Internet connection? Will their Internet plan or number of credits allow them to send all the audio files you expect?

It can be helpful to combine background audio recording with :doc:`audit logging <form-audit-log>` to have more context while listening to the recording. Recording starts at the ``form start`` and ``form resume`` events and stops at the ``form exit`` event. You can use the difference between the ``form start`` time and the start time of an event to identify how far into the background recording a certain event happened.

Background audio recording user interface
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

While recording is ongoing, an audio status bar is shown at the top of the screen. This bar helps remind data collectors that they are being recorded and provides visual feedback about audio volume.

If a data collector exits a form and then re-opens it for editing, audio recording is resumed. Audio recording continues as long as the form is open, even if another application is in the foreground or the screen is locked. Note that Collect settings can't be accessed directly from a form that has background recording. The audio file sent to the server will include audio from every time that the form was opened for editing.

.. tip::

  Android devices can make many sounds during use and these will be included in recordings. We recommend turning off sounds from button presses, camera shutters and notifications before recording.

There is an override available to data collectors when recording might compromise safety or when consent to record can't be obtained but it's still important to capture some data. When the audio recording option is unchecked, audio recording ends immediately and any previously-recorded audio is deleted. Recording can't be resumed during the current form-filling session. Toggling the audio recording option back on indicates that the next form filling session should be recorded. If :doc:`audit logging <form-audit-log>` is enabled, a ``background audio disabled`` event will be logged if a data collector toggles off recording and a ``background audio enabled`` event will be logged if a data collector toggles it back on.

Background audio recording troubleshooting
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In some rare cases such as the device running out of space, the recording may complete successfully but not be attached to the form. If this happens, the recording may be available in the ``recordings`` folder of the :ref:`Collect directory <collect-directory>`. This folder is never cleared so consider emptying it yourself once you have retrieved its files.

The ``background-geopoint`` question type lets you automatically capture a single geolocation in :ref:`geopoint format <location-widgets>` when the user changes the value of another question. The geolocation reading with the highest accuracy received in a 20-second window after the triggering question is changed will be recorded. To capture location automatically when first launching a form, see :ref:`start-geopoint <metadata-start-geopoint>`.

If geolocation information is unavailable, the question will be left blank. Reasons for a blank value may include the enumerator turning off location providers, Collect not having location permissions, Google Play Services not being installed, the GPS not having satellite lock and more. No troubleshooting information is provided in the form submission.
