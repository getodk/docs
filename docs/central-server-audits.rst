Some details will sometimes appear in the :guilabel:`Details` column. The details view will be improved in future versions.

The table always defaults to only showing audit events from the current calendar day. To select a different date range, click on the date in the filter bar. A calendar will appear:

You can click on two separate days to select a range of those days, or you can select a single day by clicking on it twice. Dates and times are always filtered and displayed according to the local time on the computer you are browsing the administration panel from.

You can also filter by the type of audit action instead. To do this, click on the dropdown to the left of the date, which by default is labeled :guilabel:`(All Actions)`.
