The source for ODK documentation published at https://docs.getodk.org.

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/getodk/docs/issues) if you can't find what you are looking for.

> [!NOTE]
> The source for the [Central API documentation](https://docs.getodk.org/central-api/) is managed [in the Central code repository](https://github.com/getodk/central-backend/blob/master/docs/api.yaml) and copied here as part of the Central release process.

## Building and viewing documentation

### Prerequisites

 * Install [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 * Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 * Install [Git-LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
 * Install [Enchant](https://abiword.github.io/enchant/).

We highly recommend you use a virtual environment like [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). If you need to use different versions of Python, we recommend [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

You can also use Docker to build and view the docs:

```bash
make autobuild-docker
```

### Cloning the repo

Clone the docs repo and make sure all the requirements are installed:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/getodk/docs.git
$ cd docs/
```

If you wish to use virtualenv, now is a good time to set it up:

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

You will see `(venv)` next to your prompt to indicate you are working within the docs project. To exit this mode, use the command `deactivate`.

Whether you are using virtualenv or not, you next need to install the dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It can take a long time (>10 minutes) to clone the repo due to the large number of images in the docs. If you get an error such as `Smudge error` or `GitHub's rate limit reached`, run `git checkout -f HEAD` until you get the message `Checking out files: 100% done`.

### Building the docs

Once your environment is set up, build and serve the docs locally with:

```bash
$ make autobuild
```

You can then view the docs in your browser at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The docs will auto-build and refresh as you make changes to the source files.

You can use `make dirhtml` to for a one-time build of the HTML files and `make clean` to clean the build.

If you would like to add a screenshot of Collect, please make a copy of [this Figma document](https://www.figma.com/design/Hbk9VpMD9KSlLXHmhT3jwv/Collect-frame-for-docs?node-id=549-9&t=9KseMozGrZ12QXcc-0) to use as a template. You can then expand either "Template" or "Bottom Template" and find the "Screen" child. Import your screenshot as the fill for the Screen. You can then export the template as 2x for use.

## Troubleshooting
- If you get an `extension error` or a `configuration error`:
  - Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
  - Type `python --version` to check your current python version (it should be 3.10+).
  - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
